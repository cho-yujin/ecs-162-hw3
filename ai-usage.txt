We used ChatGPT assistance for one part of this assignment.
Our comments were not pushing to MongoDB and we couldn't figure out why.

ChatGPT was not very helpful. It kept telling us to do things we had already tried (such as specifying a POST route in app.py).
However, it did suggest to test whether the issue was with Mongo or Flask.
Due to this, we wrote some tests (blank GET requests) to see if we could get localhost:8000/comments to display anything.
Because it did not display anything, we determined that the issue was that we were unable to connect to Mongo, because the URI to connect to MongoClient was incorrect.

Other than this one portion we struggled on, we mostly used the Svelte docs and the MongoDB slides to write our code.
