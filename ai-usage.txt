We did not use any AI assistance for the code for our project. 
We did use online documentation for Typescript syntax and unit testing, as listed below.

These were used to learn unit testing using Vitest, in addition to discussion slides:
https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about 
https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/testing 
https://vitest.dev/api/assert.html 
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/ 

We did use ChatGPT assistance for issues we had in downloading packages, such as:
Searching up random git commands that I forgot about.
For debugging: when trying to download Vitest, my silicone Mac wonâ€™t download a module correctly so I had to show chatgpt the error message and it helped me undownload and then redownload vitest and everything work.
